# Astro CMS
Proof of concept to see if [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) is a good fit for our CMS.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- go to the demo page

Spoiler alert. There's not much to see, because the page
content doesn't render itself recursively.
